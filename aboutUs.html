<p>Josh built the css for this website.  He also used Vue.js to build the details page and the catalog page.  He did the research to figure out how to develop the pokedex and shared it with Nic.  He has had previous experience with web development, which is reflected in the work that he did.</p>

<p>Nic designed the html for the about and about us pages.  He found images for each of these and wrote the paragraphs associated with those pages.  He also developed some css in relation to those pages.</p>
